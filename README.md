# plugin.SofaPython3
A python plugin for Sofa offering a pythonic interface and python3 support.


# Requirement Install
- pybind11 (minimal 2.2.4)
- cmake (minimal 3.12)
- developement package for python3 (-dev)

# In-tree build
Add this directory path in `CMAKE_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES`.

NB: This plugin cannot be build through in-build process when the old SofaPython plugin is activated. To have both SofaPython3 and SofaPython you need to use out-of-tree build.

Validate it works.
